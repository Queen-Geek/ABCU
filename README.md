# ABCU

For this project I had to load in a CSV file and extract data from it. The extracted data was used to inform the user of the prerequisite courses reuired for the course selected. It also let them know all course information from the course number entered by the user. I approached this problem by researching how to get the CSV Parser to work in C++; I then used the knowledge gained to get my program to read in a multiple line CSV file. For my roadblocks, I reached out to my tutor to assist. My work on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing program by teaching me how to ask questions about what I didn't understand to get the information needed for this specific project. I wrote comments and named my function by what they do to improve my code's maintainability, readability, and adaptability.
